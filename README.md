 This project is a classic implementation of the popular Tic Tac Toe game, where two players take turns marking X's and O's on a 3x3 grid until one player gets three in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This project allows for two modes of gameplay: player vs. player, where two human players can take turns on the same device, and player vs. computer, where a single human player can play against a computer opponent.

The game was developed using C++, and it is designed to run on Windows operating system. The game has a simple user interface, with a clean and intuitive design that makes it easy to play.

In this README file, you will find information about how to download, install, and run the game on your local machine. You will also find instructions on how to play the game, the rules that apply, and how to switch between the different game modes.

We hope you enjoy playing Tic Tac Toe as much as we enjoyed building it. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact us. Thank you for checking out our project!
